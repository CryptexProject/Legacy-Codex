## Overview:
```
a python suite for cryptography. it will contain several ciphers 
and to encrypt, decrypt, and bruteforce text.
```

## Resources:
- [ ] python3

## Components:
- [ ] plaintext encryption
- [ ] ciphertext decryption and bruteforcing
- [ ] file input and output
- [ ] text input and output
- [ ] oneliners

## Roadmap:
- [ ] build packages [ciphers] 
	- [ ] caesar [rot13] 
	- [ ] vigenere
	- [ ] multiplicative
	- [ ] reverse
	- [ ] base64

## Extraneous:
- [ ] future additions
	- [ ] xor
	- [ ] phonetic
	- [ ] binary
	- [ ] octal
	- [ ] hex
	- [ ] morse
